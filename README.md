### Overview
This project involves conducting a comprehensive analysis of A/B testing results for a website's redesigned landing page to determine its effectiveness compared to the original. The analysis is performed using statistical techniques in Python within a Jupyter notebook environment.

### Tools and Technologies
Python: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
Pandas & NumPy: For efficient data structures and numerical operations.
Statsmodels: Used for performing regression analyses and hypothesis testing.
Matplotlib & Seabolin: For visualization of data and analysis results.

### Key Features
Data Wrangling: Cleaning and formatting the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Generating initial insights and identifying patterns.
Hypothesis Testing: Evaluating the statistical significance of the observed differences between the control and treatment groups.
Regression Analysis: Estimating the impacts using logistic regression to control for various factors.

### Results
Detailed insights into the effectiveness of the new landing page, supported by statistical evidence and visualizations. Conclusions are drawn based on the analysis, guiding future website design decisions.
